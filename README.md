## Demo

Two types of ground movements: running and walking.

There are several ways of jumping:

- you can perform a standard jump or a short one;
- while in the air you can drift sideways, perform a double jump or fall faster;
- you can also jump through one-way platforms and drop back down.

While in the air, you have one last movement option: air dashes. They allow you to quickly move through the air at eight different possible angles, though it takes quite a bit of time before you can freely move after performing one, so use them sparingly!

Combo attack!

In this clip, the red rectangles represent melee attacks and the orange ones represent projectiles.

This combo can be broken into four stages:

- the big projectile acts as a launcher, and is used to start the combo;
- the two light melee attacks are used as a platform extention;
- the small projectile is a filler, it adds a bit more damage but can be skipped;
- finally the horizontal air dash and the heavy melee attack are acting as the combo finisher, sending the opponent far away.
